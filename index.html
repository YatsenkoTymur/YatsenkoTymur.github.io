    Why Teenagers Need Better Literacy
  </h1>
  <h2>
    I cannot convey how frustrated am I, the moment I once again see one of those kids, playing games on his iPad. They do not teach the parents how to install applications on their PCs anymore, nor do they write mods for their favourite games.
  </h2>
  <h2>
    It makes me remember my good old colourful days. And I think I know the main difference behind this decadance - I had no mobile device, I had a laptop! Teens nowadays learn typewriting at school, WE learned it at home!
  </h2>
  <h2>
    That's why I oppose giving those new fancy mobile devices instead of computer. Of course you will be constantly playing games, scrolling around on social media and doing nothing more, when you have neither a keyboard, nor even a tiny bit of opportunity, that you have on a laptop.
  </h2>
  <h2>
    Now I strongly encourage you to share your opinion with me. What do you think needs to be done, in order to give our new generation a tiny little bit more of digital literacy?
